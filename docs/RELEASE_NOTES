------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2001.08.01 16:00 UTC - jpcap v0.00.09

  New Functionality

    o Many new link-layer types are supported including Linux cooked sockets
      in order to successfully capture packets from the pseudo-device 'any'.

      can be disabled via a property for shells without escape code 
      support.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2001.06.27 01:00 UTC - jpcap v0.00.07

      occurring is configurable via properties/simulator.properties.

    o Network package is more complete. Previous jpcap releases only 
      provided accessors for 'interesting' header fields. All fields 
      for all supported packet types, including IP, ARP, ICMP, UDP, and 
      TCP are now accessible via the corresponding classes.

        java and libpcap installation locations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2001.06.06 23:00 UTC - jpcap v0.00.05
packaged as: jpcap-0.00.05.tar.gz, jpcap-0.00.05-1.i386.rpm

  New Functionality

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2001.06.05 20:00 UTC - jpcap v0.00.04
packaged as: jpcap-v0.00.04.tar.gz


  New Functionality 
 
    Core Capture Facility -- net.sourceforge.jpcap.capture

      o In native component (jpcap.c) error/exception handling is 
        consolidated.

      o Package no longer contains any dependencies on external 
        third-party jars.

      o Capture performance is enhanced by the elimination of unnecessary 
        device link-type queries.

      o PacketCapture core class now implements handler interface and 
        generic packet dispatcher.

      o RawPacket interface is now cleaner. Time is encapsulated in 
        util.Timeval. Redundant length information is removed.

    Capture Console and Visualization Tools -- net.sourceforge.jpcap.client

      o On systems with little memory on a busy network, the VM would quickly
        run out of memory. The user can now put an upper bound on the history 
        buffer size, causing it to behave like a FIFO which discards older 
        packets when the history buffer exceeds the specified size.

      o In the visualization plot, unknown IP communications are now 
        labelled with the protocol type, even when jpcap doesn't have an 
        implementation of the packet type.

      o ICMP communication vectors are now labelled with the ICMP message 
        type.
      
    System Simulator -- net.sourceforge.jpcap.simulator

      o New framework in place but not yet functional.


  Bugs Fixed

    o Packet capture/dropped statistics now work.

    o PacketCapture.getNetmask() was previously broken because the case of the 
      method didn't match the native implementation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2001.05.28 21:00 UTC - jpcap v0.00.03
packaged as: jpcap-v0.00.03.tar.gz

  Major modifications to packet capture facility with changes to the 
  capture interface. First release of network traffic visualization tool.


  New Functionality

    o The sample client application has been enhanced to render
      a real-time graphical visualization of network traffic 
      flow between hosts during packet capture.

    o Two types of data capture are now supported. Raw packet data capture 
      for clients implementing RawPacketListener and high-level packet 
      object capture for clients implementing PacketListener.

    o For clients capturing packet objects, the following packet types 
      and protocols are currently supported:

        Packet
          EthernetPacket
            ARPPacket
            IPPacket
              ICMPPacket
              TCPPacket
              UDPPacket

    o Added support for link-level transports with packet headers other than 
      ethernet.


  Bugs Fixed

    o Incorrect handling of some exceptions thrown from C to Java through
      JNI were crashing the VM.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2001.05.17 23:15 UTC - jpcap v0.00.02
packaged as: jpcap-v0.00.02.tar.gz

This is the initial developer's release of jpcap.


  New Functionality

    o Most libpcap functions are encapsulated in libjpcap.

    o High-level packet capture interface is exposed in the class
      net.sourceforge.jpcap.capture.PacketCapture

    o A sample client which uses the core PacketCapture class has 
      been developed. net.sourceforge.jpcap.client.CaptureTool is a 
      console-based client which demonstrates and exercises many of the 
      packet capture api's.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2001.05.15 00:00 UTC - jpcap v0.00.01
packaged as: jpcap-v0.00.01.tar.gz
