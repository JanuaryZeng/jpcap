         net.sourceforge.jpcap build information - Windows


  Active jpcap development is taking place on Unix platforms.
  However, jpcap should run on any platform where libpcap is implemented.

  If you'd like to build the .dll yourself, the following instructions 
  should work on Windows with MinGW.


  Build Procedure

    1. Install the prerequisite tools:

      o Get the Java 2 SDK, if you don't already have it:
          http://java.sun.com
 
      o Download and install MinGW and MSYS, if you don't already have it:
          http://www.mingw.org/download.shtml 

      o Download and install the WinPcap developer's pack and auto-installer:
          http://winpcap.polito.it/install/default.htm
 
      o Download the latest jpcap source tarball:
          http://sourceforge.net/projects/jpcap


    2. The script scripts/env_jpcap is an example environment setup script.

       The file env_jpcap contains PROJECT_HOME and WINPCAP_HOME
       environment variables which you MUST EDIT.

       After editing the script, open a MSYS shell window and execute:

         # setup your jpcap development environment
         . ~/path/to/jpcap/scripts/env_jpcap


    3. Build the project using MinGW's gnu-make. In the MSYS shell window:

         # build the project
         cd ~/path/to/jpcap/
         mingw32-make



    This procedure was tested using MinGW 3.1.0-1, MSYS-1.0.9,
    Sun's JDK1.4.2_04 and WinPcap v. 3.1.
