              net.sourceforge.jpcap installation information


  Installation Procedure

    0. These instructions are only relevant if you fetched the .tar.gz 
       distribution. If you are reading this, you've probably already 
       fetched and unarchived the distribution. If so, skip to step #4.

    1. Fetch the latest jpcap distribution from http://sf.net/projects/jpcap.
       The distribution is a tar file. i.e. jpcap-X.YY.ZZ.tar.gz

        The tar file contains the following:
          - jpcap project source and class files compiled for any platform
          - source code for libjpcap (a pcap wrapper containing java hooks)
          - libjpcap.so compiled for Linux/intel platforms
          - makefiles for building the project on most unix platforms
          - a sample application for visualizing network traffic

        The distribution does not contain pcap.
        libpcap can be downloaded from its authors at http://www.tcpdump.org/.

        If you are using Windows, you'll need to install winpcap from
          http://netgroup-serv.polito.it/winpcap/

        For instructions on tweaking jpcap to run on Windows, check out
          http://kalug.linux.org.tw/~chihchun/Lab/index.php/Jpcap

     2. Unarchive the jpcap distribution using the following command:
        gunzip -c jpcap-X.YY.ZZ.tar.gz | tar xvf -

     3. Go into the directory containing the distribution:
        cd jpcap-X.YY.ZZ

     4. A shell script wrapper which runs the sample capture and network
        traffic visualization tool is located in jpcap/scripts/jpcap.

     5. You may need to edit this script file to specify the location where 
        a Java VM is installed on your system.

     6. Run the test application:

          ./jpcap


        In order to use certain commands, including 'capture', you might 
        need to run the application as root.


     7. If you need assistance, check under Forum (in the Help area) 
        or under Support (in the Support Request tracking tool.)

          The project is hosted at http://sf.net/projects/jpcap/
