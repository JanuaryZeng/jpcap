  Description of jpcap.simulator package contents.
  Used by javadoc to generate package-level information.

</head>
<body bgcolor="white">

Provides a simulator which has an external interface identical to the 
PacketCapture class available in the jpcap.capture package.
<p>
Instead of capturing packet data off a network, the simulator 
fabricates packets according to configurable properties and policies.
Classes in this package are useful to developers working on 
applications that utilize the packet capture system who wish
to specify or have a high level of control over network 
data arriving into their application during the development process.
<p>
Possible applications for the simulator are unit testing client 
packet capture applications or producing boundary case network 
traffic which is rarely encountered on a real physical network.
