  This directory contains information about the Java packages that 
  comprise the jpcap project.


  jpcap.capture -- Packet capture core

    The shared-library and core networking and capture classes are found in
    net.sourceforge.jpcap.capture.

    PacketCapture is the central class used for packet capture operations.

    To capture packets, a user application must implement either the 
    RawPacketListener or PacketListener interface and then register 
    with an instance of PacketCapture using either the 
    addRawPacketListener() or addPacketListener() method.

    After registering, the application must use the open() method 
    to attach to a network interface and then call the capture() method to 
    start receiving packets.

    The procedure is relatively straightforward. In this directory is a 
    simple command-line application which captures a raw packet and exits. 
    The test stub can be invoked using the command:

      java net.sourceforge.jpcap.capture.CaptureTest


  jpcap.net -- Packet/Protocol library

    A library of supported packet types and protocols are found in 
    net.sourceforge.jpcap.net. The hierarchy of currently supported
    packet types and protocols is:

      Packet
        EthernetPacket
          ARPPacket
          IPPacket
            ICMPPacket
            IGMPPacket
            TCPPacket
            UDPPacket

    When capturing packets, the system returns the most specific 
    instance of an object recognizable by the system. For example,
    using the PacketListener interface, if a packet is captured 
    which can be recognized as IP protocol, but not discernable as ICMP, 
    TCP or UDP, then the system will return an instance of IPPacket.

    If it can be ascertained that a packet is a specific protocol, like TCP,
    then the system will send a TCPPacket. The user application can always
    cast a specific packet object, like TCPPacket, up to a more generic
    instance like IPPacket or EthernetPacket.


  jpcap.client -- Sample client applications - CaptureTool

    CaptureTool is a text-based console packet filtering and 
    capture application which builds on jpcap. The application
    also features a graphical component which can be used to 
    visualize network traffic.

    The tool can be invoked using the command: 

      java net.sourceforge.pcap.client.CaptureTool

    See the target 'test' in jpcap.client/makefile.


  jpcap.simulator -- Packet capture simulator

    The simulator package contains a pseudo network device and classes 
    which randomly generate packets based on a configurable policy.

    The simulator can be enabled by editing properties/tool.properties.


  jpcap.tutorial -- Packet capture samples

    A tutorial on using jpcap to capture network packets is in the 
    net.sourceforge.jpcap.tutorial package.
