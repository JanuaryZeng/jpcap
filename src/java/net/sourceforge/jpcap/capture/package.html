Provides an interface for capturing packets and a layer of abstraction 
around libpcap, a portable native system library for capturing network 
packets.
<p>
PacketCapture is the core of the packet capture system provided by jpcap.
<p>
Applications wishing to capture network packets create an instance of 
PacketCapture and call its methods in order to open a network device,
set packet filters and ultimately receive packet data from the network.
<p>
PacketCapture utilizes a publish/subscribe pattern to broadcast packets 
to all objects which have registered as listeners for events of 
interest. Applications capturing network data must implement PacketListener 
and register with an instance of the capture system in order to receive
packets.
